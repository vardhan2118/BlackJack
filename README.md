Hi,Welcome to BlackJack game.
The game rules are very simple.
Initially when you start the game,two random card numbers will be displayed.
If the sum is equal to 21, you won,
If the sum is more than 21, you are out of the game,
If the sum is less than 21, you have a chance to draw a new card until the sum is less than 21.
